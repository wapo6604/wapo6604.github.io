  <p>
  Hi! I am Wayne, an Honours student studying pure mathematics at The University of Sydney. Welcome to my Portfolio! 😊
  </p>

  <p>
  I am particularly interested in partial differential equations, spectral theory and functional analysis. 
  I have also dabbled in a few statistics and data science projects. Check them out in the <a href="{{ 'research' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">ML Projects</a> tab.</p> 

  <p> I've collated some awards and grades in the <a href="{{ 'education' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Education</a> tab.</p>
  
  <p> I've also done some engineering work with the University's Formula Student team. Check it out on the <a href="{{ 'blog' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">🔩 FSAE Blog</a>.</p>
  
  <p> Feel free to contact me at {% highlight ruby %} H(dot)Zheng(at)maths.usyd.edu.au {% endhighlight %} if you see something on my website that catches your eye. 😁</p>
