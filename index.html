  <p>
  Hi! I am Wayne, a student in their final semester of mathematics and physics at The University of Sydney. Welcome to my Portfolio! 😊
  </p>

  <p>
  I am particularly interested in algebraic geometry, measure theory and functional analysis. 
  I have dabbled in creating simulations for dark matter and anyons in a lattice. Check them out in the <a href="{{ 'research' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">ML Projects</a> tab.</p> 

  <p> I've collated the subjects I have done here <a href="{{ 'education' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Education</a> tab.</p>
   
  <p> I've also done written some articles for the University of Sydney's Physics Society's Jeremy. Check it out on the <a href="{{ 'blog' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">🔩 FSAE Blog</a>.</p>
  
  <p> Feel free to contact me at {% highlight ruby %} wapo6604(at)sydney.edu.au {% endhighlight %} if you see something on my website that catches your eye. 😁</p>
