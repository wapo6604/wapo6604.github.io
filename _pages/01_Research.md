Here are some interesting research projects in machine learning and statistics.

### Consistency Results in Estimating the Number of Clusters
*Supervised by A/Prof Clara Grazian*.  
 We prove a new result on the consistency of Pitman-Yor models in estimating the number of clusters in a mixture model. We show a positive consistency result for the case of a Uniform prior on the concentration parameter.

### Sampling Approaches to Graph Clustering and Evaluation on the StringDB PPI
*Supervised by Prof Georg Gottwald*.  
 We explore a new approach to clustering networks by sampling from a distribution of possible modularity resolutions, computing the Louvain partition for each resolution, and then taking a consensus result. We then explore a way of evaluating our clusters with stochastic block models.

### Hidden Markov Models for Analysing Stress Levels in Working Dogs
*Supervised by A/Prof Clara Grazian, funded by Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute.*  
 We explore novel methods for improving the analysis of multivariate hidden Markov models on time series with both fast and slow dynamics. We also explore data-cleaning methods for very noisy biological sensor data.

### Bayesian Model Selection for Logistic Regression via Variational Bayesian Interference
*Supervised by A/Prof John Ormerod.*  
We develop a novel method of performing simultaneous model selection and regression using the reverse collapsed variational Bayesian method. Our algorithm outperforms $k$-NN and random forests in cross-validation MSE performance, and is available as an <code>R</code> package.
